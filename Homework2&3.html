  <h2>Original Visualization </h2>
  <p>Recently, during an informal conversation with my friend, we started talking about how so many people today have advanced degrees while about a decade ago even a Bachelors
    degree would be a luxury for most. I was curious to see if an advanced degree was actually as popular as we thought it was especially in the US, which inspired my data idea for this assignment.
    While looking at different articles and trends, I stumbled upon an article about people in the US above the age of 25 who do not have a high scool education. This piqued
    my interest since I have always viewed high school education as a necessity and hence wanted to dwelve deeper into it.

  <h2>Critiquing the Original Visualization </h2>
  <p> <h3>Negatives:</h3><br>My First thought when I looked at the graph was that there are so many charts. Roughly 16 bar charts. The title for the chart was also really vague. If it was'nt
    for the rest of the webpage, It would take me quite some time to figure out whats going on in the chart. Additionally, the numbers on the y axis of the graph are actually
    percentages and bar charts are not the best way to represent percentages, pie charts or tree maps represent percentages better. Finally,
    associating colours with the race was difficult and I had to keep referring to the legend to identify which colour was for whom. I would instead put the races under each bar so that the audience would not have to keep looking at the legend. 
    </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <h3>Positives:</h3><br> There were some positives to this chart too. The chart portrays the distinction between national and foreign which is an important criterion for the 
    audience to consider to identify if immigration laws should be taken into account while offering recommendations. The charts also provides a lot of insight about division
    of population by ethnicity, sex and region which can help organizations make informed decisions regarding next steps

  <h2>United states economic trends over the years </h2>
  <p> It is interesting to note how the USA trends change over the years. Here I used a radial tree which is sorted in descending order of government debt. I highlighted USA in red
    since that is also the colour used to highlight USA in graph 1 and hence helps the audiences brain to immediately relate red to USA. All the other countries have been greyed out so 
    we can solely focus on the USA trends across the years with respect to other countries. Overall we notice that USA is 6th highest as compared to other countries which is bad 
    since high government debt signals potential decline in economic opportunities. If we look at the trend by clicking on each year we see that from 1995 to 2007, USA was
    still about 6th or 7th in ranking which while low was not too much of a crisis. However between 2007 to 2008, it jumped up 2 places and became the 4th highest in governent debt
    which is concerning</p>

  <h2>Summary and Conclusion </h2>
  <p> Government debt of a country is an important factor to consider since high debt results in reduced national income, high interest, tax hikes and budget cuts.
    It also results in reduced ability of a country to respond to security problems and poses a great risk of fiscal crisis Source[<a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-consequences-growing-national-debt" style="color:blue"> CRFB </a>]
    . We first started by analyzing the general government debt data deom the OECD website, Source[<a href="https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm" style="color:blue"> OECD </a>].The website had data until 2021 but we chose to look at 2020 so we can have the entire
    years data and make better assumptions. Here we notice that Japan has the hightest debt which might signal a major potential recession within the country. We
    also wanted to look into the debt of USA and noticed that while not the highest, it is still ranked 4th amongst the other countries for highest debt. Its ratio is about 70%
    higher than the OECD average which is quite concerning. Our second graph helped us deep dive into these countries economic standings by observing their trends between 1995-2019. 
    However, it is difficult to parse through data of so many countries and eventually the chart gets more confusing than informative.</p>
    <br>
    <p> To overcome the excessive information problem posed by the above graph we create a radial tree which helps us glance through all the countries in a single view.
       This also gives us an option to select years from a dropdown menu to see the trend. Here, we highlighted US in order to track its economic journey across the years and we 
      find that the significant change in debt happend between 2007 to 2008 where it jumps up a few places to become the 4th highest country with government debt. This makes 
      sense since 2008 was a period of <b>Global Financial Crisis</b> It was among the five worst financial crisis in the world leading to a loss of more than $2 trillion from
       the global economy. Home mortgage debt in the US also increased from about 46% in 1990 to about 73% in 2008. Large US banks lost about $1 trillion on toxic assets which 
      resulted in loss of investor confidence and plummeting stocks, Source[<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008#:~:text=Several%20businesses%20failed" style="color:blue"> Financial crisis of 2007–2008 </a>]. We also notice that in 2011, US debt grows even more and it is now at the 2nd position. This is due 
      to the rise in budget cuts, high layoffs. However, this period also saw a rise in customer consumption which eventually led to a reduction in debt in 2012, Source [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/29/us-economic-growth-slows-down-sharply" style="color:blue"> 2011 Economic Slowdown </a>].
