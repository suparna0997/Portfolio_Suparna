  <h2>Project Outline </h2>
  <p>In the recent years software engineering and coding jobs have become so popular that even those who are not interested in coding are forced into taking up software engineering jobs to make a decent living. 
    The aim of my project is to find alternate career options that pay wages comparable to a tech or software engineering job but does not require any coding skills. 
    This will help people leverage my analysis to plan out potential career opportunities based on varied interests.</p>

  <h2>Project Structure </h2>
  <p><b>Analyse college majors: </b>
    I plan to start my story with some data showing the most popular courses to study today. 
    Based on some of the information I saw online, most of the data would be skewed towards engineering and technology. </p>
  <p><b>Analyse employment or post college placement statistics:</b> I would then follow this up by looking into some of the employment statistics. 
    I anticipate a lot of people focused on technical jobs. This would further support my claim that students are in a way forced to take up technology and sciences 
    since they are conditioned to believe that these are the jobs that pay the highest.</p>
  <p>I would follow this by a short article on why more people are moving toward tech followed by a question. 
    “If tech degrees are the key to success are all millionaires/CEOs coding geniuses?”. 
    I plan on giving examples of Melody McCloskey, Micheal Dell and a few more and how they are non tech founders of successful companies</p>
  <p><b>Non technical roles in technical companies:</b> While founding a new company altogether is definitely a great way to get richer, not everyone has a entrepreneurial 
    goal or mindset. Look into high paying management or non tech roles at top companies. Focus not just on roles like product management or business but also 
    creative roles like UX designers etc. Find and show statistics to get average salaries in the field. Also show degrees that they potentially look for.</p>
  <p>Comparison of salaries: Look into salaries of non technical roles. Create a data visualization for the same and compare these with tech salaries to prove the 
    point that you don’t need to be software engineer to make money.</p>
  <p>Conclude by telling people that they do not need to fall into the traditional path of tech and can tweak their interests into high paying jobs as well thus encouraging people to follow their passion.</p>

  <h2>Methods and Mediums: </h2>
  <p> I really enjoyed exploring the features of shorthand and would be using that as the primary tool to host and display my story. Since I would also need to display a lot of charts, 
    I plan on using flourish and Tableau to create the required charts that would depict my story better.</p>
    <p>I really liked the idea of enlarging the main insight numbers so I plan to incorporate that to show data like “Percentage of people pursuing technical degrees etc”. I also plan on including quotations from famous CEOs who have creative degrees since that would create a better impact for my story. 
      Finally, I would also want to explore more comparison techniques to prove that non tech jobs are just as attractive as tech jobs.</p>
