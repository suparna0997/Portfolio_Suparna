  <h2>Project Outline </h2>
  <p>In the recent years software engineering and coding jobs have become so popular that even those who are not interested in coding are forced into taking up software engineering jobs to make a decent living. 
    The aim of my project is to find alternate career options that pay wages comparable to a tech or software engineering job but does not require any coding skills. 
    This will help people leverage my analysis to plan out potential career opportunities based on varied interests.</p>

  <h2>Project Structure </h2>
  <p><b>Analyse college majors: </b>
    I plan to start my story with some data showing the most popular courses to study today. 
    Based on some of the information I saw online, most of the data would be skewed towards engineering and technology. </p>
  <p><b>Analyse employment or post college placement statistics:</b> I would then follow this up by looking into some of the employment statistics. 
    I anticipate a lot of people focused on technical jobs. This would further support my claim that students are in a way forced to take up technology and sciences 
    since they are conditioned to believe that these are the jobs that pay the highest.</p>
  <p>I would follow this by a short article on why more people are moving toward tech followed by a question. 
    “If tech degrees are the key to success are all millionaires/CEOs coding geniuses?”. 
    I plan on giving examples of Melody McCloskey, Micheal Dell and a few more and how they are non tech founders of successful companies</p>
  <p><b>Non technical roles in technical companies:</b> While founding a new company altogether is definitely a great way to get richer, not everyone has a entrepreneurial 
    goal or mindset. Look into high paying management or non tech roles at top companies. Focus not just on roles like product management or business but also 
    creative roles like UX designers etc. Find and show statistics to get average salaries in the field. Also show degrees that they potentially look for.</p>
  <p>Comparison of salaries: Look into salaries of non technical roles. Create a data visualization for the same and compare these with tech salaries to prove the 
    point that you don’t need to be software engineer to make money.</p>
  <p>Conclude by telling people that they do not need to fall into the traditional path of tech and can tweak their interests into high paying jobs as well thus encouraging people to follow their passion.</p>

  <h2>Methods and Mediums: </h2>
  <p> I really enjoyed exploring the features of shorthand and would be using that as the primary tool to host and display my story. Since I would also need to display a lot of charts, 
    I plan on using flourish and Tableau to create the required charts that would depict my story better.</p>
    <p>I really liked the idea of enlarging the main insight numbers so I plan to incorporate that to show data like “Percentage of people pursuing technical degrees etc”. I also plan on including quotations from famous CEOs who have creative degrees since that would create a better impact for my story. 
      Finally, I would also want to explore more comparison techniques to prove that non tech jobs are just as attractive as tech jobs.</p>

  <h2>United states economic trends over the years </h2>
  <p> It is interesting to note how the USA trends change over the years. Here I used a radial tree which is sorted in descending order of government debt. I highlighted USA in red
    since that is also the colour used to highlight USA in graph 1 and hence helps the audiences brain to immediately relate red to USA. All the other countries have been greyed out so 
    we can solely focus on the USA trends across the years with respect to other countries. Overall we notice that USA is 6th highest as compared to other countries which is bad 
    since high government debt signals potential decline in economic opportunities. If we look at the trend by clicking on each year we see that from 1995 to 2007, USA was
    still about 6th or 7th in ranking which while low was not too much of a crisis. However between 2007 to 2008, it jumped up 2 places and became the 4th highest in governent debt
    which is concerning</p>

  <h2>Summary and Conclusion </h2>
  <p> Government debt of a country is an important factor to consider since high debt results in reduced national income, high interest, tax hikes and budget cuts.
    It also results in reduced ability of a country to respond to security problems and poses a great risk of fiscal crisis Source[<a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-consequences-growing-national-debt" style="color:blue"> CRFB </a>]
    . We first started by analyzing the general government debt data deom the OECD website, Source[<a href="https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm" style="color:blue"> OECD </a>].The website had data until 2021 but we chose to look at 2020 so we can have the entire
    years data and make better assumptions. Here we notice that Japan has the hightest debt which might signal a major potential recession within the country. We
    also wanted to look into the debt of USA and noticed that while not the highest, it is still ranked 4th amongst the other countries for highest debt. Its ratio is about 70%
    higher than the OECD average which is quite concerning. Our second graph helped us deep dive into these countries economic standings by observing their trends between 1995-2019. 
    However, it is difficult to parse through data of so many countries and eventually the chart gets more confusing than informative.</p>
    <br>
    <p> To overcome the excessive information problem posed by the above graph we create a radial tree which helps us glance through all the countries in a single view.
       This also gives us an option to select years from a dropdown menu to see the trend. Here, we highlighted US in order to track its economic journey across the years and we 
      find that the significant change in debt happend between 2007 to 2008 where it jumps up a few places to become the 4th highest country with government debt. This makes 
      sense since 2008 was a period of <b>Global Financial Crisis</b> It was among the five worst financial crisis in the world leading to a loss of more than $2 trillion from
       the global economy. Home mortgage debt in the US also increased from about 46% in 1990 to about 73% in 2008. Large US banks lost about $1 trillion on toxic assets which 
      resulted in loss of investor confidence and plummeting stocks, Source[<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008#:~:text=Several%20businesses%20failed" style="color:blue"> Financial crisis of 2007–2008 </a>]. We also notice that in 2011, US debt grows even more and it is now at the 2nd position. This is due 
      to the rise in budget cuts, high layoffs. However, this period also saw a rise in customer consumption which eventually led to a reduction in debt in 2012, Source [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/29/us-economic-growth-slows-down-sharply" style="color:blue"> 2011 Economic Slowdown </a>].
